### 👩‍💻 About the Project  
This to-do list was developed as part of my journey into mastering JavaScript basics. It helped me practice working with the DOM, handling user interactions, and building a modular task system. The goal was to go beyond basic task apps by adding restore logic, completion tracking, and celebratory feedback—all within a clean, responsive interface using Tailwind CSS.
